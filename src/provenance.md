# Provenance

Pointers are not just integers. That is a wrong abstraction.  
If we treat pointers as integers, we get things wrong.  
We need to define a type called 'Pointer' and another called 'Integer'. They may look and act similar in certain scenarios, but they are not usually the same.  

I have a joke : I will treat pointers like true intergers
```rust
fn main(){
    let x :u32 = 10;
    let x_ptr = &x as *const u32;
    let x_ptr_usize = x_ptr as usize;
    let x_ptr_u8 = x_ptr_usize as u8;
    let x_ptr2 = (x_ptr_u8 as usize) as *const u32;

    unsafe {
        println!("old address of x = {}", x_ptr_usize);
        println!("new address after conversion between diffefent kinds of integers: {}", (x_ptr_u8 as usize));
        println!("new garbage value of x = {}", *x_ptr2);
    };
}
```


Provenance is the attached metadata to a pointer type.  

In Rust, the provenance of a pointer is the combined information on : 
1. The set of memory addresses that the pointer is allowed to access in an allocation (this obviously includes the exact address of that pointer) - this is **spatial** information.
2. The timespan during which the pointer is allowed to access those memory addresses (reffered to as Temporal aspect of provenance)
3. Whether the pointer may only access the memory for reads, or also access it for writes.  


If a pointer has the above information available, you can say that *That pointer has provenance*.  
If a pointer is misssing the above information, you can say that that pointer *does not have provenance* - that pointer is as good as just another integer.  



## Why Do we need provenance
This information will help up track pointers, ALL pointers. (smart pointers, references, and raw pointers)  
We will see their lifetimes, their overlapping allocations, their access-rights.... and we will be able to track them...

Now people are happy. I want you to jog!
